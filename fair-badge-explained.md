# FAIR badges

This badge describes and visualises the compliance with FAIR Sofatware
recommendations as described on [fair-software.eu website](https://fair-software.eu/) site.
The [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) and [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/) launched fair-software.eu with five
actionable and practical recommendations that help researchers to make their
software more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

We want to incentivise research software engineers and researchers who develop
software to implement these FAIR recommendations, by making their effort and
compliance with the fair-software.eu recommendations more visible to the rest of
the world. We also want to promote the recommendations to a wider audience.
